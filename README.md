# scPred: Network analyses of single cell-based digital twins for personalized treatment of inflammatory diseases

### scPred: General information

The goal of scPred is the creation of multicellular network-based disease models 
from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for drug repositioning.
scPred was developed using mouse data and validated in in vitro experiments 
and by application to human scRNA-seq data consistently showing a high 
precision for already approved drugs for the investigated diseases.

Analysis was mainly conducted in R 3.4.4.
Input data can be downloaded as described in PMID: XXXXX 

### Creation of 3D network visualization for interaction between plasma cell DEGs and drug candidates

In order to better understand the interactions between DEGs and drug candidates, selected based on zc < -1.64 and dc < 1, we created a 3D [visualisation](https://scpred.shinyapps.io/3D_network/) for the most central cell type (plasma cells) in the antigen induced arthritis mouse data. Interactions between DEGs (blue) are representing protein-protein interactions (PPI) described in the literature-curated PPI network by do Valle et al. DEGs node size is based on fold change. Drug candidates are connected to their respective gene drug targets by edges. Potential drug candidates are shown in red. Established drugs for human rheumatoid arthritis are represented in yellow. The higher the absolute value of a drugs Y-axis value the higher the drug rank. Drug candidates that counteracted at least one DEGs fold change received positive Y-axis values while drug candidates that did not counteract the fold change of any targeted DEG received negative Y-axis values.  The visualization was created in R version 4.1.1. The following R packages were used: igraph (1.2.6), plotly (4.10.0) and shiny (1.6.0).
