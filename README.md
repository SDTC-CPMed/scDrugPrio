# scPred: Network analyses of single cell-based digital twins for personalized treatment of inflammatory diseases

### scPred: General information

The goal of scPred is the creation of multicellular network-based disease models 
from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for drug repositioning.
scPred was developed using mouse data and validated in in vitro experiments 
and by application to human scRNA-seq data consistently showing a high 
precision for already approved drugs for the investigated diseases.

Analysis was mainly conducted in R 3.4.4.
Input data can be downloaded as described in PMID: XXXXX
